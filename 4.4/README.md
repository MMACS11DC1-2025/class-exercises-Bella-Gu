HOW IT WORKS:
    - The computer will print a vine spiral with petals and leaves.
    - It will ask you how big you want the spiral to be, and what colour you want the petals to be. (NOTE: if the colour entered is not something that the computer knows, ex. sage green, it will automatically be a black petal.)
    - It works because the recursive function will start once the questions are fulfilled, stopping once it hits the base case.
    - If the size of the spiral is too big or small, it can cause performance issues and be difficult to see.

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
    - Run the program by entering values to the 2 questions, and watch a recursion pattern appear.

TEST CASES:
    1) - Size = 50, colour = red
        - Expected a fast execution and small pattern
        - Results works as expected: shows a small spiral with red petals
    2) - Size = 300, colour = orange
        - Expected a slower execution and the spiral to take up the whole screen
        - Results works as expected: shows a beautiful, big spiral
