CODE OVERVIEW
    - My code is about bread. The program will print the percentage of how burnt it is and also print the top 5 most burnt breads. (with the percentage) #dftyguinmko
    - I imported 10 images of a mix of breads and toasts. Some toasts are more burnt than others.
    - The code will scan through all the pixels for each of the 10 photos and detect which part of the bread is burnt and not burnt.
    - My 'def is_target_feature()' will return RGB values. As the code iterates, it will determine which colour category it belongs to because of the function. Ex. white category, light brown category... etc.
    - After it is done scanning an image, it will bring back a percentage of how much it is burnt. It will print 10 percentages in total.
    - It will get the amount of pixels in each colour category, add the most burnt colours (dark brown and black), divide it by the total area of the bread, and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
    - In the end, it will #ftuygiuhijj


    - I would say that this code is accurate because it #oiuuyntbrvcexwq and the percentages are precise. #srdtyfvyubunij
